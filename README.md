# Commercial-Detection-in-TV-News-Channels

This project focused on classifying TV news segments as either commercial or non-commercial using a diverse dataset of 150 hours of footage from five news channels, including both Indian and international sources. The dataset, recorded at 720 x 576 pixels and 25 frames per second, provided audio-visual features for accurate classification.

By leveraging Machine Learning techniques, this project aimed to develop a model capable of distinguishing between commercial breaks and regular news segments despite these variations.
