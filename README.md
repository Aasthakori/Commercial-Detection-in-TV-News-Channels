# Commercial-Detection-in-TV-News-Channels

This project focused on classifying TV news segments as either commercial or non-commercial using a diverse dataset of 150 hours of footage from five news channels, including both Indian and international sources. The dataset, recorded at 720 x 576 pixels and 25 frames per second, provided audio-visual features for accurate classification. The main challenge was handling the variability in presentation formats, especially from Indian news channels, which often have inconsistent news formats. By leveraging Machine Learning techniques, this project aimed to develop a model capable of distinguishing between commercial breaks and regular news segments despite these variations.
